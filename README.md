The Coffee Sales Dashboard offers a detailed and interactive overview of sales data from January 2019 to August 2022. This Excel dashboard is designed to help users filter and analyze sales based on various parameters, making it easier to understand market trends and customer preferences.

The dashboard allows users to filter sales data by **Order Date**, providing the flexibility to analyze specific periods. Users can also filter by **Roast Type**, choosing among **Dark**, **Light**, and **Medium** roasts to see which types are most popular during different times of the year. The **Size** Options filter enables the analysis of sales data based on coffee package sizes, including **0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, and 2.5 kg**. This feature helps in understanding the popularity of different packaging options and their impact on sales.

Another useful filter is the **Loyalty Card** option, which allows users to see the influence of loyalty programs on sales. By analyzing data with and without loyalty card usage, businesses can better understand the effectiveness of their customer retention strategies.

The dashboard includes several key visualizations to present data in a clear and insightful manner. The Total Sales Over Time line graph illustrates the sales trends for various coffee types, such as Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta. This graph highlights seasonal patterns and peaks in sales, helping businesses identify the most popular coffee types over time and make informed inventory decisions.

The Sales by Country bar chart displays the geographical distribution of sales, with the United States leading significantly, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom. This visualization is crucial for understanding market performance in different regions and can guide marketing and sales strategies to focus on the most profitable markets.

Lastly, the Top 5 Customers bar chart identifies the top customers based on sales volume, showcasing the key contributors to revenue. Understanding who the top customers are can help businesses develop personalized marketing efforts and loyalty programs to retain these high-value customers.

Overall, the Coffee Sales Dashboard is a powerful tool for businesses to analyze sales data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. By providing an interactive and visually engaging way to explore sales information, this dashboard helps businesses enhance their performance and better meet customer needs.
